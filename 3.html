<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p><strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as JS, is a
 programming language that conforms to the
 <strong>ECMAScript</strong> specification. JavaScript is high-level,
 often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
 It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
<p>Alongside <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and
is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have
a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
