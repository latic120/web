<h2>WEB</h2>
The <strong>World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the<strong> Web</strong>,
is an information system where documents and other web
resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
(URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be
interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.
The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software
application called a web browser and are published by a
software application called a web server. The World Wide Web 
is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web
in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.
